# 🌐 CSS Colored Markers - ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/in%20progress-yellow)

A visual practice project from freeCodeCamp focusing on complex CSS styling to create realistic markers using gradients and shadows.

## 🛠 Technologies
* **HTML5:** Structured using nested `div` elements for marker components (cap, sleeve).
* **CSS3:** Advanced styling with `linear-gradient`, `box-shadow`, and color transparency (RGBA/HSLA).

## 🚀 Features
* **3D Visuals:** Simulating cylindrical shapes using multi-stop linear gradients.
* **Translucency:** Implementation of a "sleeve" effect using semi-transparent overlays.
* **Color Systems:** Practice with RGB, Hex, and HSL in a single project.

## 🧠 The Process
1.  **Skeleton:** Creating the marker containers and their sub-parts (`cap`, `sleeve`).
2.  **Color Depth:** Applying three-color gradients to create a lighting effect.
3.  **Refinement:** Adding shadows and borders (like the `double` border on the sleeve) for a polished look.

## 💻 Running the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
